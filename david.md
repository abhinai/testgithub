                                                                     
                                                                     
Mechanics
=========

1) about "Collections +"

when you hit + it takes you to a new main frame listing your collections where you have the ability to create a new collection

I'd prefer having the + sign open up into a lil mini-window where you can quickly name a new collection (a la iTunes) instead of taking you to a whole new page. at least that's what I assumed would happen when I clicked the "+", but it didn't


2) I really wish the sidebar on the left would not move, so then you could scroll in just the main frame and quickly drag and drop to the sidebar no matter how many URLs you have in the main frame.  when I had more than 5 or so sites there, I had to scroll down and I could no longer see the sidebar so I couldn't drag and drop.  I also wonder if the left sidebar should have its own scroll eventually, esp if you create like 50 collections.


3) when you're looking at the unlabled list, once an unlabled item is labled, I kinda expect it to 'disappear' to its folder, but it doesn't. this makes the list still feel 'cluttered,' unless you constantly refresh it. then again, you're probably worried about people wanting to stick things in multiple collections...

4) everything so far is "one at a time." would be nice to quickly check like 5 different links and send them to a certain collection

A question: can there be sub-collections?  for instance, I made a History collection but it would be nice to divide that into a bunch of sub-sections


General thoughts
================

Overall I still haven't completely made my mind up about the program yet.  I really love the overall idea, especially the potential to create personal information-sharing networks on a huge scale (and also between friends).  I think it would be a really cool way for people to make available what they know, especially if they are an expert in some particular area.  I think it is still missing something, though, something that sets it apart from all these other sites people are already using.  In short, you need to make it "addicting," the kind of site people want to come back to when they have free time or when they should be working, and it has to fulfill some kind of need, fix some kind of problem, get people movtivated to use it.

So far it's still a little too much like an 'advanced' version of bookmarks, essentially bookmarks + sharing.  if you add the ability to upload files, then it will still be very similar to dropbox.  It also probably overlaps a lot with Reddit, although Reddit is less about building up your own collection of data and more about making lots of little posts to me, where it possibly gets really exciting is not sharing links, or pictures (that's what FB, Picassa, etc. are for), but actual documents, data, etc. then again, I'm thinking about this as an academic


Psychology
==========

I think a lot of these websites work because of vanity.  you want to "display" how cool you are so that others can recognize that, and this sort of website probably taps into a slightly different version, which is displaying all the cool things you know, or at least know of. it could be marketed as a way of sort of "helping others/the world" with your knowledge.  almost like wikipedia but everyone has their own.  it might be a way for people to create something more than just a profile page, allowing them to create essentially their own digital/informational world. that isn't possible with FB, and definitely not with normal bookmarks.  maybe with dropbox... so at least in the long run it might be good to have a kind of 'homepage' for each person where others can come and see/browse their amazing collections.  a little like Youtube's "channels, maybe."  this could actually work really well for academia, because there are certain historians whose pages I'd like to visit to see what kinds of collections they have there's also the appeal of browsing what your friends think is cool/worth reading, and facebook isn't necessarily the best place for that at any rate, what you have to do is get into the users' heads. what will motivate them to use your site?  what will keep them coming back for more?

Functionality
=============

I've been thinking about what the program as it stands is generally good for.  In my limited use, I've basically used it to archive pages that I have come across that I think might be useful in the future, but that either I don't have time to see now or I think I won't remember the names of.  Typically I've used bookmarks for this sort of thing, of course, but my bookmarks tend to be pretty disorganized, with long lists of non-related things in them.  I've over the last week or so I've found that I actually don't visit all that many "new" sites, at least not ones I found interesting enough to want to save (so much stuff on the internet is basically 'view once, then toss'), so I honestly haven't felt too much of a need for the service Kliptag provides.  Most of the time I visit the same 10 or so sites, which I either have prominently bookmarked already with Chrome or I use the autocomplete function, which gets me there like .5 seconds slower but works just fine for pages I use a lot.  I see a problem with Kliptag being that it doesn't necessarily make browsing faster, unless it's a question of pages that you simply can't remember off the top of your head, so speed may not end up being one of its selling points (not sure if it's meant to be).  So, in its current state, it seems to be most useful for people who visit a lot of different sites that they plan on coming back to or that they want to share.  Since I don't have any friends on Kliptag, I haven't been able to really test the sharing thing.  Typically when I share links with people it's one at a time, and I just copy and paste.  Unless you're trying to share a bunch of links at once, I don't see logging on to Kliptag and creating a new shared folder being necessarily much more efficient.  Of course, it sounds like you're planning on adding much more than links, and I am most interested in the information generation/sharing possibilities as the project moves forward.

Where the Appeal Lies
=====================

this definitely appeals to people who are into 'organizing,' including as a procrastination exercise. you feel like you've accomplished something after you've sorted a bunch of sites (even if you haven't).  I'd definitely make sure that 'organizing' feeling stays in place, and maybe it could be expanded.  the 'drag and drop' feature is especially nice.  I think the other possible appeal is connected to the 'vanity' thing I mentioned before, which is basically the desire to show people what you know, how much you know, etc.  I would say there might be some appeal to businesses, but I have the feeling there is a ton of sophisticated software out there already that lets them do sharing/collaboration


Aesthetics
==========

clean and simple. looks just fine, and has plenty of room for growth.

Major Questions
===============

1) Who are the target audience?

2) what will motivate people to use it?

3) Why is it better than, and how is different from A) copying and pasting links to your friend(s), B) bookmarks, C) facebook/Myspace, etc., D) Dropbox, E) Reddit

4) How open do you envision it?  Dropbox is already great for sharing with a couple friends, Reddit's good for sharing info to lots of people on specific topics.  I personally think this kind of thing gets better when things are shared widely, but you could make it so one can change the sharing properties of any given collection

5) How can you get companies involved (if you want to)?  So far this is completely personal.  However, a lot of successful sites have achieved popularity partly because they are also good for businesses, at least in theory. (Groupon, Fb, Twitter, etc.)

6) How will you eventually monetize it?  this should always be influencing decisions on things such as #4

7) What need is this fulfilling? and/or what is this making more efficient?


Other Questions
===============

1) Are you planning on incorporating any kind of rating system, and/or having a Reddit-like 'front page' where people see what sites are popular?


Possible Suggestion(s)
======================

I think the idea can go in a number of directions, since it's essentially quite simple (which is good).  Here is one direction I can see it going in: users create collections not only of links but of basically everything imaginable, from pictures to pdfs to Word docs and even videos, making them viewable to whatever audience they select (friends, friends of friends, etc.).  users designate themselves as "experts" in certain areas and in this way other users can seek out, say, really good cooks and see what recipes they have, or editors and what books they recommend, climbers and what climbing gear they use, historians and what books they like and what archives or sources they use, foodies and what their favorite restaurants are, etc.  I see it becoming a little like everyone's personal wikipedia, but much more information-driven than Facebook or Mypage or whatnot.  The thing is, you need to motivate people to post data/links/whatever it is and I think the feeling of being an 'expert' is a good way to make that happen.  There could then be some kind of rating system to help determine what is popular, where the most helpful information is, etc.  So if I'm going on a trip to Taiwan and I want to know how to prepare for it, I could instead of going to wikipedia or some travel website find various people who have personally visited Taiwan and written about their experiences or posted some kind of info about how to survive there.

The basic point is, I think in the information business, in order to actually get information from people you need to either get them to talk about themselves a little (a la Facebook 'favorite things'), offer some kind of financial incentive (Groupon), make them feel good about themselves (foursquare), get them to play some kind of game, or appeal to their sense of authority in some area or another.  Reddit kind of does the latter, but not systematically. At any rate, in the very long term you have to figure out how to actually make $ from this.  I'm not sure links and/or collection names alone can give you enough information to do effective targeted advertising. But if you get someone to declare him/herself a cooking expert and compile a big list of recipes, then your site could show them ads for silverware and Amazonfresh or something.  And you could have some sort of awards/recognition for posting a lot of stuff.

Random Completely Unsolicited Idea
==================================
I had nothing to do on the bus to Chicago, so I was thinking about what I would do if I made a startup.  I think it would be called yayornay.com and the only function it would have is for people to rate things (pictures, ideas, products, whatever).  on the one hand, people could crowdsource things like "should I wear this shirt to my date tonight?" [pic] and get instant feedback from friends or wider constituencies, categorized by gender, age, friendship group, nationality, whatever.  on the other, people could rate products or product ideas.  if McDonald's wants to come up with a new burger it usually does some kind of focus-group stuff, but this would be a way for it to pretty much conduct a worldwide poll without bothering people with surveys.  It would reverse the survey idea completely, allowing people who are bored to go around rating various products and ideas based on whatever interests them (rather than having an ad/survey shoved in their faces that they care nothing about), so people who like food might rate local restaurants, etc.  The rating would be very simple at least initially--either yay or nay, and you could include a little explanation of your rating.  people LOVE to demonstrate that they have "good taste".  Companies could be charged a small fee, and/or offer prizes to people for rating lots of their products or ideas.  Anyway, I have no idea if you'd want Kliptag to go in a direction like that, but if you add some kind of rating system it might be a possibility.
